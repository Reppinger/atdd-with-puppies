Refine the script for adopting two puppies to make it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and then
DAMP (using Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases).

1. Extract Method:

To remove our most obvious source of duplication, make a method to adopt a puppy given its number.
The name of the method might be "adopt_puppy_number". Call this method from the main script.

2. Introduce Variable:

The adopt_puppy_number method does not have access to the "browser" local variable. Fix that by introducing
an instance variable @browser.

3. Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases:

Although the rest of the actions are not duplicated, the steps of adopting two puppies still do not read very
descriptively. By making well named methods for each operation, we can develop a small "domain-specific language" 
so that the script reads very closely to the way you actually think about the tasks involved in adopting puppies. 

 - go to the puppy adoption site
